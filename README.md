# MinecraftMod_1.21.5CheesyTest
ModLearning

This template is to help keep as a backup if anything goes wrong or if I want to create
a new mod project. Finding the resources has been a Mofo. So instead making a one stop
easy place to grab from will help immensely. 

This is modding for minecraft 1.21.5 with forge (55+)

This uses gradle 14 which the gradle-wrapper.properties will specify where that comes from.
If there is a need to change the gradle version go here: https://services.gradle.org/distributions/
|
\____> right click, copy link, and make the value the distribution of the gradle version
       you want gradle to build into the project

You will also need parchment which will also partly integrate with the mod project
itself here.

Necessary parchment info here: https://parchmentmc.org/docs/getting-started

I'm learning from this tutorial: https://youtu.be/eFofdJ1BYYs?si=q-A4cL_-C-8F19B6

That tutorial required the previous information input into this readme. 

Will be updating this readme as I go into coding and making mods to make an easier
guide for users to mod minecraft.
